# Kazoo 5 project task register

Updated: 2026-09-06. This is the project-wide priority/status index. Detailed
incident evidence remains in [deployment tasks](doc/deployment_tasks.md) and
[acceptance status](doc/kazoo5_acceptance_status.md); earlier passes are scoped
evidence, not proof that later regressions or production acceptance are closed.

Statuses: **ACTIVE** = implementation/investigation underway; **OPEN** = not
accepted; **BLOCKED** = named external input needed; **VERIFIED** = only the
explicitly stated test scope. An item is complete only when its source,
installer integration, API documentation and relevant tests agree. Changes must
be committed and pushed before the delivery is reproducible from the remote.
Final delivery target requested by the operator: `master`. Integrate reviewed
work without discarding team changes or force-pushing; verify the destination
and remote state before publishing. Fresh per-module, ALL and distributed-server
installer acceptance remains required, not inferred from unit tests.

## Active team coordination — 2026-09-06

The operator's team handed off commits `1634524` (directly tracked ACDC source)
and `83194e7` (delayed queue-satisfaction/outbound-agent recovery) on branch
`fix/acdc-outbound-agent-availability`. The operator explicitly authorized merging
the combined work and continuing. Both commits are already ancestors of the
current checkout; do not reapply their exported patches or recreate nested Git
metadata. ACDC source in `applications/acdc` is now canonical; historical ACDC
patches are compatibility fixtures, not the installation source of truth.
Our phone-service commit `49ccb98` is also on this branch. Preserve all changes
and reconcile the pending installer/UI work against this combined source.

The handoff reports 48 unit, 26 strategy and five migration checks passing,
with no deployment or restart. Independent combined testing now passes all 48
unit tests, all 26 strategy tests in two disjoint guarded groups, and six
expanded source-ownership groups. Remaining integration checks are still being
revalidated;
this is not live-call acceptance. Regenerate affected API coverage and run
combined call-delivery/callback regressions before release. The private callback
audio adapter still needs native completion, cancellation and owner-handoff
proof before promotion; the handoff does not waive those safety gates.

## P0 — call delivery and callback correctness

| ID | Status / owner | Work and acceptance requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0-01 | ACTIVE — API + UI | Queue-specific Login: backend committed `4fc2a2b` with 12 isolated regression groups passing and exact fresh pinned installer-patch replay; explicit-selection UI committed `d263342` with focused/full contract passes. Source-bound OpenAPI overlay/reference committed `22b5f94`, with 9 focused groups / 45 schema cases passing. No silent roster changes or other-agent logout; membership is not readiness. Regenerate/publish `/apis`, deploy and test selected-agent ringing. |
| P0-02 | OPEN — acceptance | Re-test extension 2000 after the operator selects the intended queue agent. Observed roster Agent 12 logged out; globally ready Agent 19 unassigned; runtime knows no eligible agents. Do not reset all agents to conceal the mismatch. |
| P0-03 | ACTIVE — callback | Key 6: identified queue audio starved behind endless hold. Private immediate-audio candidate passed 58 distinct offline cases, but source review found synchronous native playback behind a five-second RPC timeout and blocked call-control handling. Candidate deployment is held for correction/native boundary proof; offline passes do not close this risk. Handle invalid return caller ID clearly; durable registration before success audio/BYE, position retention and unanswered-first-attempt retry require live acceptance. |
| P0-04 | ACTIVE — callback | Callback offer at configured 30 seconds: separate enable, initial delay and repeat interval from position/wait/generic announcements; verify saved values, runtime schedule and received audio. Invalid return numbers must not cause silent failure. |
| P0-05 | OPEN — ACDC | Agent stability: one answered call must not log unrelated agents out. Test failed ringing, reconnect, queue-specific logout, pause/resume and reboot recovery. |
| P0-06 | OPEN — ACDC | Resolve retained ambiguous callback cleanup/reconciliation ticket without losing evidence or falsely marking a live leg settled. |
| P0-10 | OPEN — callback; investigate later as requested | Operator report, 2026-09-06: pressing callback key 6 played "unable to perform action" and ended the call instead of confirming that an agent would call back. Root cause and callback-ticket state are not yet verified. Reproduce later with a correlated call/queue ID and logs; check durable callback registration, selected media and disconnect handling. Confirm success only after the ticket is durably accepted; on failure preserve a safe caller recovery path rather than falsely confirming or unexpectedly ending the call. Acceptance includes spoken confirmation, intended disconnect, subsequent callback and unanswered-first-attempt retries. No new live test is authorized by this report alone. |
| P0-07 | ACTIVE — staging acceptance | Team recovery fix `d69cf04` merged in `8548b98`; combined 174 tests and 63 production-module compile passed. Bounded reconciliation must now be validated with actual lost/late hangups, multiple direct calls and node reconnect. Never mark an agent available while another tracked call is active; preserve pause/logout and membership. SIP registration alone is not recovery proof. |
| P0-08 | ACTIVE — staging acceptance | Team AMQP recovery fix merged and covered by the combined offline checkpoint. Actual broker interruption, lost acknowledgements/redelivery and node failures remain untested: prove no permanently stuck ringing state, duplicate bridge, stolen call or unrelated agent/roster mutation. Broker acceptance alone must not count as completed state recovery. |
| P0-09 | OPEN — ACDC policy + UI/API | Repeated connection failures can automatically log agents out (operator review finding). Distinguish intentional configured protection from unintended logout; define configurable thresholds and recovery behavior, expose the reason/current state through API/UI and document it in OpenAPI. Test threshold boundaries, transient failure, successful-call counter reset, reconnect and explicit operator logout. Do not silently disable unreachable-agent safeguards or automatically override an intentional logout. |

Native callback candidate review remains part of P0-03, not a completed fix:
revocation acknowledgement is not proof that the full native playback stack has
finished. Bridging must reserve both call legs and wait for actual completion
before side effects. A candidate owner-change-away-and-back race also requires a
non-reusable binding generation in both native state and wire requests. The
earlier ten-test/eight-wire-shape codec proof does not cover that new field or
native transport. Core/module lifetime, exact bridge-end release, stale requests,
native build/link and real audio acceptance must pass before promotion.
Private core-source session `19793` passed nine groups plus real-header syntax
checks, including owner-generation reuse, admitted-write quiescence and exact
bridge-ticket release. The core native dispatcher and actual bridge/end caller
hooks are still being implemented; these private proofs do not certify deployed
callback behavior or constitute an installer-ready patch.

The three recovery findings above were added from the operator's 2026-09-06
review and are release-blocking P0 items, not fixed by `83194e7`. That commit's
delayed-notification regression verifies recovery after direct calls finish and
preserves pause/pending logout. Independent testing also passed those three
cases. The first two resource-capped unit runs stopped in mock setup; a subsequent
run passed all 48 tests using EUnit's supported slow-host timeout scaling and a
narrow configuration mock. The same 384 MiB / 50% CPU cap and 120-second outer
limit remained enforced; production timers and assertions were unchanged.
The external team's recovery commit `d69cf04` is now integrated by kz5 merge
`8548b98`, with its six production-module changes preserved. Root independently
passed all 174 combined Erlang tests: 22 recovery, 48 unit, 26 strategy,
16 recovery I/O and 62 historical media, plus six source-ownership checks.
The first merged historical media run exceeded an incorrectly selected
120-second outer deadline; the documented 900-second allowance passed with
unchanged memory/CPU caps. This does not certify current native playback or
all-language behavior. Root also independently compiled all 63 top-level
production modules with `-Werror`, with input freshness and no TEST build
options or agent test exports; no running BEAM was replaced or loaded.
See `doc/acdc_agent_recovery.md` for exact evidence.
P0-07/08/09 remain release gates for coordinated staging, broker/node failures,
real calls and load/soak testing. Genuine `max_connect_failures` protection is
preserved; policy UI/API documentation is not closed by the FSM fix alone.
Each new P0 requires a
reproducer, code and installer integration, focused fault-injection regression,
and relevant live call/state/log evidence before closure.

## Dashboard and workforce delivery

The supplied folder contains four designs, covering two live screens and two
historical screens. Exact references and API/data requirements are in
[the dashboard implementation brief](doc/dashboard_delivery_plan.md).

| ID | Status / owner | Work and acceptance requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DASH-01 | OPEN — UI | Live queue overview using `Queues Live Dashboard Main.png`: sortable queue cards, SLA, waiting/handled/abandoned counts, wait/handle durations, queue administration actions. |
| DASH-02 | OPEN — UI | Clicking a queue opens its live detail using `Queues Live Dashboard.png`: KPI cards, queue-scoped agent/call states, search/filter/sort, performance and authorized spy/whisper/barge/join controls. |
| DASH-03 | OPEN — API | Bounded account/queue dashboard snapshots with source timestamps, completeness, metric definitions, pagination and authorization. Reuse source APIs where adequate; consolidate backend reads rather than browser fanout. |
| DASH-04 | OPEN — events | Reuse native Blackhole for authenticated account/queue-scoped WebSocket updates, not a duplicate transport server. Snapshot/event ordering, duplicate/gap handling, reconnect/resubscribe/resync, server-side token expiry/revocation, stale indicators, bounded buffers and multi-node ownership. Native delivery is best effort and has no durable replay cursor; account-hierarchy checks are not queue permissions. No silent polling-only substitution. |
| DASH-05 | OPEN — API + docs | Define/version dashboard request, response and event schemas. Publish HTTP contracts in OpenAPI at `/apis`, link WebSocket message/subscription/lifecycle documentation; distinguish proposals from deployed endpoints. Test schema conformance and tenant isolation. |
| DASH-06 | OPEN — UI + reporting | Queue historical dashboard using `Queue Historical Dashboard.png`: time/queue filters, call outcomes, SLA, wait/handle/talk metrics, details and export. Reconcile counts, timezone boundaries and late events. |
| DASH-07 | OPEN — UI + reporting | Agent historical dashboard using `Agent Historical Dashboard.png`: agent/queue/date filters, last activity, outcomes, talk/break/idle durations, details and export. Define attribution for transfers/multiple queues. |
| DASH-08 | OPEN — API + Next.js acceptance | Explicit company/account, queue and agent filtering contracts for snapshots and native Blackhole subscriptions. Company means Kazoo ACCOUNT_ID, not a free-text company name; enforce tenant and queue/agent permissions on the server, including wildcards and reseller/sub-account access. Document selected-queue and selected-agent examples, supported filters, unauthorized/unknown IDs and switching scope without leaking old events. Existing generic call bindings are not queue dashboard bindings. Test isolation, reconnect/resnapshot and filter changes with a real Next.js integration before marking ready. |
| DASH-09 | OPEN — API + docs | Add live agent dashboard contracts alongside company queue overview, selected-queue live detail and queue/agent history. Publish versioned HTTP request/response/error schemas at /apis and linked WebSocket bindings/event schemas, with copyable Next.js examples. Clearly label planned versus implemented versus deployment-tested contracts; do not advertise invented dashboard routes as callable. Test actual responses/events against schemas and exercise examples against the matching deployment. |
| BH-01 | ACTIVE — deployment acceptance | Token/reason/unsupported-frame redaction is packaged as a pinned installer patch; session `86439` passed eight public-entry tests, six production compiles and exact source replay. No live deployment yet. Malformed JSON and generic application-payload logging, authentication lifetime and full protocol security remain separate gaps; see `doc/blackhole_resilience.md`. |
| BH-02 | ACTIVE — security | Context result classification bug reproduced (five failures/one control), corrected in source (six groups pass, 18786); combined replay and ten public-handler tests including mixed-denial dispatch prevention pass (69993). See doc/blackhole_binding_results_acceptance.md. Enforce and test socket authentication lifetime, token/account changes, expiry/revocation and missing/failed auth modules; existing cached authenticated context is not sufficient. Preserve tenant isolation and add queue/resource permissions for dashboard bindings. |
| BH-03 | ACTIVE — deployment/security acceptance | Finite inbound frame/reassembled-message limits, malformed/non-object rejection and close-reason redaction implemented in installer patch. Session 62506 passes 13 real private-Cowboy wire groups, eight production compiles, exact schema/source replay and cleanup checks. Initial 38610 exit99 rejected because runner changed; clean rerun required and passed. Connection limits/trusted proxy identity, live deployment, load and unrelated-session stress remain open; no total-memory or whole-log-safety guarantee. |
| BH-04 | OPEN — resilience | Slow-client/backpressure policy and observable loss/resync: current emitter can silently drop events and replies over its mailbox threshold. Do not claim replay/exactly-once semantics. Add bounded buffers, load/failure tests and frontend stale/reconnect handling without a duplicate transport service. |
| BH-05 | ACTIVE — deployment acceptance | Native Blackhole handshake, discovery, JSON frame schemas and Next.js lifecycle reference committed in `63e6bf7`, passed offline/browser checks, and published at /apis (12 exact HTTP assets, `73763`). Proposed dashboard contracts remain distinct. Native app/listener and reverse proxy, separate-node configuration, reconnect/failover, TLS and real authenticated event delivery still require production acceptance. |
| WFM-01 | OPEN — product + UI | Workforce report in the same design language: agent/date/queue filters, login/logout times, sessions, working hours, total breaks and breakdown by break type; drilldown and export. |
| WFM-02 | OPEN — API + storage | Durable agent session/state-transition and break-reason records with identifiers, timestamps, provenance and runtime confirmation. Handle missing logout, restart, duplicate/late events, overnight shifts, timezone/DST and multi-queue sessions without double counting. |
| WFM-03 | OPEN — API + docs | Workforce summary, session details, break-type catalog and export APIs; access control, bounded ranges/pagination and OpenAPI schemas/examples/errors. Separate break configuration changes from reporting reads. |
| WFM-04 | OPEN — acceptance | Define paid/unpaid break policies and working/available/talk/wrap-up/idle time explicitly. Report unknown/incomplete intervals; never infer payroll hours from SIP registration. Reconcile totals and test exports, corrections/audit trail, retention and sensitive-data access. |

## Queue features, voices and APIs

| ID | Status / owner | Work and acceptance requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACDC-01 | ACTIVE — auth/deployment acceptance | Unified queue create/edit/read. Queue recovery UI `8c11030` passes 15 source-browser cases. Backend malformed/foreign-extra/empty-revision acknowledgement bugs reproduced, fixed, then all 41 editor/manifest tests passed (`68783`), including partial/lost replies, persisted receipts, fresh roster/revisions and no automatic resend. Real restricted-token controls and current-revision live/deployment acceptance remain required. |
| ACDC-02 | OPEN — UI | Reliable Callflows ACDC action and internal extension routing; dropdowns instead of technical free-text fields; default prompt selection must not trigger required-field errors. Preserve existing customer recordings. |
| ACDC-03 | OPEN — ACDC | Verify/build supported ring strategies: ring-all, ordered, round-robin and existing alternatives. Resolve simultaneous-answer/DTMF exit ownership candidates; test fairness, single winner and cleanup. |
| VOICE-01 | OPEN — media + UI | Finalize EN/HE/AR/FR/ES prompt-language override, queue/call/account defaults and reseller/sub-account inheritance; report incomplete packs rather than enabling unverified choices. |
| VOICE-02 | VERIFIED — packaged assets only | Existing 165 effective Gemini entries / 330 WAVs and transcripts/provenance are committed and hash-verified. Shared system media is reusable; this is not five-language playback certification. |
| VOICE-03 | OPEN — media | Build voices once into versioned shared artifacts for all present/future accounts and sub-accounts. No Gemini generation during installation, account creation, queue editing or calls. Finish missing numeric/auxiliary audio and native listening checks. |
| VOICE-04 | BLOCKED — operator | Agree supplemental generation scope/budget and native-language acceptance; no extra provider calls have been made under an assumed approval. |
| API-01 | VERIFIED — single-server scope | Supervision eavesdrop/whisper/barge/join and stop have prior isolated audio/auth tests and OpenAPI entries. Cross-node/failover/real-traffic acceptance remains OPEN. |
| SUP-01 | OPEN — audio acceptance | Listen / silent monitor / spy uses action eavesdrop: supervisor hears both agent and customer; neither party hears supervisor. Whisper: supervisor hears the conversation and speaks only to the selected agent leg; customer must not hear supervisor. Barge-in: supervisor, agent and customer hear one another; join is the existing full-audio alias. Revalidate each directional audio matrix, target-leg selection and safe stop without ending the original call. Existing single-host evidence in API-01 does not close this release gate. |
| SUP-02 | OPEN — cluster/security acceptance | Test monitoring of authorized calls across queues and FreeSWITCH nodes, answer races, hangup, transfer, stale ownership, unreachable node, retries and supervisor disconnect. Enforce exact-account administrator and owned enabled supervisor-device checks; reject tenant crossing, raw routes/commands and stopping the original call. Correlate accepted requests to actual media connection and audit start/stop without logging credentials. No duplicate supervisor legs or unwanted mode escalation. |
| SUP-03 | OPEN — OpenAPI + installer acceptance | Keep the existing POST /accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/channels/{UUID} contract authoritative: eavesdrop, whisper, barge, join and stop_monitoring. Expand /apis with the audio matrix, agent-leg selection, request/response/errors, supervisor-leg correlation, accepted-versus-connected semantics and Next.js examples. Verify actual source-to-FreeSWITCH implementation rather than assuming Pivot, a callflow action or mod_spy is required. Add schema/example regressions, authenticated deployment tests and clean/separated-server installer acceptance before marking these features finalized. |
| API-02 | OPEN — live acceptance | Company members with owned devices/types/fresh registration state. Offline session `99855` passed 25 tests with real production authorization/JWT code against fixture stores: restricted resources, unrelated-account denial, expiry, scopes and exact inventory/page limits. Twelve contract groups pass; page-wide completeness/status constraints are published at `/apis`. Live restricted/foreign/expired principals remain unverified, and registrar limits are post-collection, not transport-memory bounds. Keep SIP online distinct from queue eligibility. |
| API-03 | ACTIVE — documentation | Repository catalog validates 354 paths / 649 operations; deterministic-regeneration/tamper, queue-login and members/device contract checks pass. Refreshed assets `ca33a9c` published at `/apis`: all 11 files match HTTP readback, redirect/404/no-store verified, rollback recorded in `70634bd`. HTTPS/browser and live endpoint acceptance remain separate; source-only proposals/gaps stay explicit. |

## Installer, deployment and release

| ID | Status / owner | Work and acceptance requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INST-01 | OPEN — installer | One modular install entry point: CouchDB, RabbitMQ, HAProxy, Kazoo apps, eCallMgr, Kazoo FreeSWITCH, Kazoo Kamailio, Monster UI and ALL; automatic pinned dependencies, configuration validation and enabled/running named services. |
| INST-02 | VERIFIED — current-host scope | Named services and `kazoo-applications` compatibility alias exist; Pivot port reservation, test-phone startup preservation and requested SUP alias repaired. Reboot/custom-root/clean-server regression tests still required. |
| INST-03 | ACTIVE — installer | Kamailio verifier repair committed `aff66d3`: 11 regression groups and live `--verify-only kamailio` pass; recovered startup JWT failure remains an explicit warning, later/unrelated errors fail, service identity unchanged. Finish combined all-module verification after remaining deployment; verify source/export availability and configuration/transport readiness. |
| INST-04 | ACTIVE — deployment acceptance | Monster production `preloadApps`/`preloadedApps` mismatch corrected. Guarded build/readback passed: 1,931 files, 465 templates, 16 canonical preloads. Actual unauthenticated artifact boot and mocked queue-login flow passed, not live authenticated API proof. The five-phase 24-suite checkpoint omitted `test-install-kazoo5.sh`; its ALL assertion was subsequently corrected and the main smoke passed in `45471`. Queue recovery fix `8c11030` passed 15 source-browser cases but needs a new matched artifact. See `doc/installer_regression_acceptance_20260906.md`; adoption, matched backend and clean-server dependencies remain unverified. |
| INST-05 | ACTIVE — build | Post-build artifact verification is wired before activation and included in the fingerprint; modular fixtures with/without ACDC pass. eCallMgr no longer trusts stale `.app` files: current-invocation build reuse, environment reset and failure-before-activation fixtures pass. Full real repeat deployment remains required. |
| INST-06 | OPEN — deployment | Publish reviewed matching source/backend/UI with exact backups, preserve unselected apps/config/customer data and record rollback. Two media/editor backend modules updated; compiled UI publication remains held. |
| INST-07 | OPEN — acceptance | Clean Rocky Linux 9 install, each module alone, all-in-one and separated hosts; hostname/address/configuration variations, reboot, repeat install, upgrades and failure recovery. No clean-server success is claimed yet. |
| INST-08 | ACTIVE — staging acceptance | False-success checks fixed in code: RabbitMQ selected-vhost permissions/exact AMQP bind (65 runtime + 32 password cases pass); external UI API envelope and early API/WebSocket validation (71 cases + main ALL smoke pass). No-route fallback fixed; dry-run no longer claims live validation. Read-only/modular/runtime-config/12 UI wiring groups pass. Actual separated-server connection/install acceptance remains required. |
| INST-09 | ACTIVE — upgrade compatibility | New combined Blackhole patch and Crossbar schema extension must upgrade known previous patched source, not only clean/already-current trees. Existing generic helper rejects that intermediate version. Add explicit reviewed old-to-new transitions with private preflight, exact current postcondition, unknown/partial-state refusal, unrelated-edit preservation and repeat-install tests; do not auto-reset source trees. |
| SEC-01 | BLOCKED — operator | HTTPS `kz5.talkchief.io`: supplied certificates have no matching private key in `/root/ssl`; provide protected matching key or explicitly authorize replacement issuance. Validate WSS and TLS renewal afterward. |
| SEC-02 | OPEN — operations | Network exposure, least privilege, secrets, SELinux policy, auth/tenant isolation, audit logs, backups, retention, monitoring/alerts and resource/disk limits. Do not equate active services with enterprise certification. |
| LOAD-01 | OPEN — acceptance | Resolve prior memory/AMQP incident; rerun sustained 30 concurrent calls and full drain, then establish measured capacity. Distinguish concurrent calls from calls/second; 80 CPS is not certified. |
| HA-01 | OPEN — acceptance | Backup/restore, failure injection, multi-node ownership, distributed queues/broker/database failover, reconnect and no duplicate callbacks/bridges. |
| REL-01 | OPEN — release | Review and credential-scan all task changes, commit source/tests/assets/docs and record exact build/test evidence. Update this register rather than marking untested features done. |
| REL-02 | BLOCKED — operator | Configure fresh protected GitHub write authentication; push reviewed commits and verify remote SHA. No successful latest push is claimed. Never reuse the exposed chat token. |

## Work order and release rules

1. P0-01/P0-03/P0-04 in parallel source work, with serialized resource-capped tests.
2. P0 live acceptance without interrupting operator calls or changing rosters
   without an explicit selection; queue-login API and UI ship together.
3. Correct production UI build and installer gates; matching deployment/browser
   checks; complete language handling without recurring TTS calls.
4. DASH-03/04/05 establish trustworthy data/events, then DASH-01/02; historical
   and workforce designs follow with validated interval/metric definitions.
5. Clean/distributed installation, security, sustained load, restore/failover and
   authenticated remote release. Document external blockers, not fictitious passes.
